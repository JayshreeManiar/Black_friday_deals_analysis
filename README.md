# Black_friday_deals_analysis

Black Friday is an informal or socially known name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States. Black Friday is not special only for its date, however it is the busiest shopping day in the nation. It becomes the busiest shopping day for a variety of reasons, however one stands out the most; there are a lot of head-turning deals on products. Also, it is a very known phenomenon in the nation that many who are interested in the deals will stand outside of the stores days before, creating a "line" for a potential best spot when the day of sales hits. These sales generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for informed business decisions, understanding consumer behavior, guiding marketing initiatives and much more.


Created a table based on user search. We created 3 filters as City,Age, Gender.

Analysis
1.We performed exploratory data analysis to find interesting trends from the dataset.
2.We analyze the amount that a customer is likely to spend on Black Friday
3.It can be easily observed that people having occupations 0 and 4 spent the most money during Black Friday sales.
4.we can easily conclude that the highest number of customers belong to the age group between 26 and 35, for both genders. Younger and older population are far less represented on Black Friday. Based on these results, the retail store should sell most of the products that target people in their late twenties to early thirties.
